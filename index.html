<p>Each meeting we are going to try and have either some type of Presentation and workshop (maybe both)
In the planning to do some Open Source Projects, Competitions (CTFs, CCDC, ITC, etc)</p>

<p>The Overall goal of 0xDeadC0de Security Club is to help its members to become knowledgeable and active members in the Information Security fields. This will include getting a deeper understanding for topics covered in class, learning programming languages, exposure to tools not covered in class and other areas of interest for club members in Information Security.</p>

<p>Anyone is welcome to be a member and participate in the club events that is wanting to learn new information, or even contribute on a topic in which they are interested in. </p>

<p>Member participation is what drives a club to either being successful or failure, so please participate as much as possible and get your friends involved.
